Based on the code search results, here are some of the libraries used in this app:

*   **next/link:** Used for creating links between pages.
*   **lucide-react:** Used for icons.
*   **react-icons/lu, react-icons/si, react-icons/fa, react-icons/md, react-icons/gi, react-icons/io, react-icons/ri:** Used for icons from different icon libraries.
*   **next/font/google:** Used for importing fonts from Google Fonts.
*   **reactflow:** Used for creating interactive graphs and diagrams.

It appears the app uses React and Next.js, along with various icon libraries and ReactFlow for visualizing roadmaps.
